This mod tweaks the Perk system to streamline it for Survival mode. It removes some useless perks, condenses 5-point perks to save points, buffs defensive perks, and reorders some perks to improve build flexibility.

Changes:
- Removes Strong Back 4 (fast travel while overencumbered).
- 5-point damage perks (+20/40/60/80/100%) are now 4 points (+25/50/75/100%).
- 5-point armor perks (+10/20/30/40/50) are now 4 points, and have been buffed (+25/50/75/100).
- Nuclear Physicist no longer reduces Fusion Core drain. It now scales Radiation Damage by +50/100/150/200%.
- Perks which grant a chance for something to happen now explicitly state the chance.
- Changed the order of Persuasion perks:
  - Refractor moved from 7 to 3
  - Awareness moved from 3 to 7
- Changed the order of Intelligence perks:
  - Scrapper moved from 5 to 1
  - Gun Nut moved from 3 to 2
  - Medic moved from 2 to 3
  - Science moved from 6 to 5
  - VANS moved from 1 to 6
