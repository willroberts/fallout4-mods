This mod tweaks the Perk system to streamline it for Survival mode.
It removes useless perks, condenses 5-point perks to save points, buffs defensive perks, and reorders some perks to improve build flexibility.

Changes:
- Perks which grant a chance for something to happen now explicitly state the chance.
- Removed Perks
  - Removes Strong Back 4 (fast travel while overencumbered), since fast travel is not available in Survival mode.

  - Removes Ricochet 3 (critical meter refill).
